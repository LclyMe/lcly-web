# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) Version of the Lcly Whitepaper

Think of Lcly as your digital village hall—an online spot where you can pop in for local news, see which bins go out when, and find out what's happening on the High Street. It's open to everyone (like a public building you can wander into), and the best bit is you know exactly how it's built and who's running it (because it's open source and totally transparent).

## Easy to Use

No faff—just hop on, set up a quick profile, and start chatting with your neighbours.

## Trustworthy

We're not here to nick your personal info or blast you with ads. Everything's about keeping things safe and reliable for real people.

## Built for the Community

Councils, local groups, or even your mate who codes on weekends can all chip in, add features, and make it better for everyone.

So if you want a single place to check local events, share tips, or just see what's going on around the corner, Lcly's got you covered—like your friendly community noticeboard, but online.
